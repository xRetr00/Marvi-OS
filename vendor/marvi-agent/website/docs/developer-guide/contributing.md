# Contributing

Thank you for contributing to Marvi Agent! This guide covers setting up your dev environment, understanding the codebase, and getting your PR merged.

## Contribution Priorities

We value contributions in this order:

1. **Bug fixes** — crashes, incorrect behavior, data loss
2. **Cross-platform compatibility** — macOS, different Linux distros, WSL2
3. **Security hardening** — shell injection, prompt injection, path traversal
4. **Performance and robustness** — retry logic, error handling, graceful degradation
5. **New skills** — broadly useful ones (see [Creating Skills](creating-skills.md))
6. **New tools** — rarely needed; most capabilities should be skills
7. **Documentation** — fixes, clarifications, new examples

## Common contribution paths

- Building a custom/local tool without modifying Hermes core? Start with [Build a Hermes Plugin](../developer-guide/plugins/index.md)
- Building a new built-in core tool for Hermes itself? Start with [Adding Tools](./adding-tools.md)
- Building a new skill? Start with [Creating Skills](./creating-skills.md)
- Building a new inference provider? Start with [Adding Providers](./adding-providers.md)

## Marvi Upstream Sync Policy

When merging Hermes upstream, preserve Marvi's downstream functionality rather
than resolving conflicts by deleting it. Protected surfaces include streaming
STT (Parakeet/Moonshine), wake word, voice presence/Dynamic Island, glow
overlay, Qwen3-TTS, PocketTTS, voice-residency/resource supervision, and their
desktop settings, IPC, installer/updater integration, and tests.

Marvi's wake word is exclusively the `voice.wake_word` "Hey Marvi" pipeline.
Do not reintroduce upstream's standalone "Hey Hermes" detector, bundled
`hey_hermes` models, top-level `wake_word` config, `/wake` command, `wake.*`
gateway RPCs, or duplicate Desktop/TUI controls.

Desktop packaging must keep the Marvi identity end to end: unpacked builds use
`Marvi.exe`/`Marvi.app`/`Marvi`, installers use `Marvi-${version}-...`, and the
Python `--build-only` resolver prefers those outputs. Legacy Hermes filenames
are compatibility fallbacks only.

Also preserve the subconscious and presence system: goals, proactive and idle
triggers, connected-account snapshots, ActivityWatch/media/rhythm observation,
distilled-memory viewer, activation REST endpoints, CLI commands, and the
Settings -> Presence/Subconscious UI. The UI must use activation endpoints;
writing config values alone does not start or stop its jobs and watchers.

Protect the Mind UI and local learning loops: narrative, reflections,
initiatives, activity, outcomes, timing, focus-app, trust, escalation,
voice-threshold, and room-habit signals, plus their configuration, scheduler,
suggestions, APIs, UI, and tests. Preserve the instant voice lane and
duplex/speaker-focus behavior, including fast model selection,
escalation/delegation, barge-in, speaker identity/self-enrollment, and
world-context contracts.

The `smart_room` plugin is also downstream Marvi functionality. Keep its skill
and manifest, Windows runtime supervision, secret/config boundaries,
BLE/mmWave/OwnTracks presence fusion, MQTT/Tuya integration, clap events,
modes, alarms, welcomes, dashboard/tools APIs, world snapshots, proactive
delivery, Desktop Settings UI, and the associated navigation, types,
localization, IPC/REST contracts, and tests.

Preserve the `hermes_cli/web_server.py` API contract for `/api/mind`,
`/api/subconscious/*`, `/api/presence/*`, `/api/learning/*`,
`/api/marvi/knowledge`, and `/api/brain/*`. The contribution desktop shell
must keep the `/mind` workspace route/sidebar entry and the Voice Presence and
provider-aware voice pipeline/warmup statusbar items; do not drop them when
retiring or restructuring `desktop-controller.tsx`.

Also protect memory maturity: episodic SQLite/FTS storage, `recall_episode`,
scheduler/distiller ingestion, reflection context, Mind Timeline,
`/api/memory/episodes`, dreaming, adaptive retrieval, reversible decay/archive,
contamination suggestions, and the Knowledge viewer. Preserve the full voice
streaming, wake-word, warmup/residency, duplex/instant-lane, speaker API, and
PocketTTS playback contract. Keep Dynamic Island work IPC, proactive
suggestion delivery, and smart-room clap learning (bounded datasets, review
APIs, notifications/settings, normal/light/sleep modes, greetings, runtime,
dashboard, tools, and tests).

NeuTTS and KittenTTS are deliberately blocked in Marvi. Do not reintroduce
their providers, installers, documentation, setup options, or UI wiring from
upstream.

Recent protected behavior also includes contribution-shell wake-word routing,
Parakeet EOU validation, first-word TTS startup, delayed speaker attribution,
instant-lane local-time injection, retained OwnTracks location history across
runtime/tools/world context/Desktop Settings, and Smart Room entry tracking.
Keep BLE-confirmed owner classification, guest/unknown visitor classification,
bounded persisted unreported-entry history, world-context exposure, and the
owner-return voice notice/clear flow even when the welcome threshold suppresses
a greeting. Also keep the OpenCode Go DeepSeek V4 thinking-disable passthrough.

Protect the newest downstream surfaces too: Graph Mind, autonomy, and Composio
APIs/UI; budgeted self-research, ask-user delivery, and the opt-in university
portal; discovered cron chat/topic targets and gated agent messaging; proactive
`defer`/`quiet`/`speak`/`telegram` modes with TTS language limits;
overlay-persistent voice mode; Dynamic Island weather/time cards; and Smart
Room mmWave debounce, sleeping-phone sticky identity, and false-alert
suppression. Keep their implementation, config, navigation, API/IPC contracts,
and tests together.

The August 2026 protected additions include instant-voice provider/model
selection with curated fallback and cancellation, phrase-streamed duplex TTS,
PocketTTS 2.1 controls, lazy streaming-provider discovery and Gepard settings,
plus Smart Room vision. Preserve the supervised camera service, independent
pose/gesture and face cadence, review-only face enrollment, unknown-face
evidence, bounded history, sleep/zone/gesture reasoning, restricted cognition,
world/proactive/subconscious wiring, plugin tools/dashboard APIs, preview, and
Desktop camera/model/face/gesture settings. Camera/model dependencies remain
optional and plugin-local.

The post-August 2026 recovery additions are also downstream-owned. Keep lazy
self-repair for configured PocketTTS and LiveKit Hey Marvi dependencies,
cancellation-safe duplex STT permits, and instant-lane natural session ending
and silent accidental-wake dismissal. Smart Room must retain managed
dependency repair, MQTT/Tuya reconnect health and probing, contention-safe
event history, sleep-safe entry lighting and vision-driven sleep, dedicated
gesture/action workers, and the bounded duplicate-aware pending-face queue.
Sampling, previews, and individual/bulk review remain available through the
plugin API and Desktop settings; identity enrollment is never automatic.

Run `python scripts/prepare_marvi_upstream_sync.py --review-only` before an
upstream merge. Use its protected-overlap report during conflict resolution,
then require `python scripts/verify_marvi_upstream_contract.py` and
`python scripts/verify_marvi_brand.py` to pass before committing.

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

| Requirement          | Notes                                                                                         |
| -------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Git**              | With the `git-lfs` extension installed                                                        |
| **Python 3.11–3.13** | uv will install it if missing                                                                 |
| **uv**               | Fast Python package manager ([install](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/))                           |
| **Node.js 26+**      | Optional — needed for browser tools and WhatsApp bridge (matches root `package.json` engines) |

### Install with the standard installer

For most contributors, the best development bootstrap is the same path users
take: run the standard installer, then work inside the repository it cloned.
The installer creates the Hermes venv, wires the `hermes` command, stamps the
install method for `hermes update`, and clones the full git project into
`$HERMES_HOME/hermes-agent` (usually `~/.hermes/hermes-agent`). That keeps your
development environment on the same layout the CLI, updater, lazy dependency
installer, gateway, and docs assume.

```bash
curl -fsSL https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/install.sh | bash
cd "${HERMES_HOME:-$HOME/.hermes}/hermes-agent"

# Add dev/test extras on top of the standard install.
uv pip install -e ".[all,dev]"

# Optional: browser tools / docs site dependencies.
npm install
```

After that, create branches and run tests from that checkout:

```bash
git checkout -b fix/description
scripts/run_tests.sh
```

You can also run a fully isolated Hermes instance (throwaway HERMES_HOME, separate Electron
userData, distinct Electron app name to avoid the single-instance lock):

```bash
scripts/dev-sandbox.sh python -m hermes_cli.main
scripts/dev-sandbox.sh --persistent python -m hermes_cli.main desktop  # state survives restarts, but lives in the worktree :)
```

### Manual clone fallback

Use this only if you intentionally do not want Hermes' managed install layout
(for example, a throwaway clone inside a container or CI job). If you install
this way, make sure you run the `hermes` entrypoint from this venv; running the
system `python3 -m hermes_cli.main` can pick up unrelated system Python
packages.

Create the venv **outside** the cloned source tree. A venv that lives inside
the directory the agent operates from can be wiped by a relative-path command
the agent runs against its own checkout (`rm -rf venv`, `uv venv venv`, etc.),
which silently destroys the running runtime mid-session. Keeping it outside the
tree means no relative path from the workspace resolves to it.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent.git
cd hermes-agent

# Create venv with Python 3.11, OUTSIDE the source tree
uv venv ~/.hermes/venvs/hermes-dev --python 3.11
export VIRTUAL_ENV="$HOME/.hermes/venvs/hermes-dev"
export PATH="$VIRTUAL_ENV/bin:$PATH"

# Install with all extras (messaging, cron, CLI menus, dev tools)
uv pip install -e ".[all,dev]"

# Optional: browser tools
npm install
```

### Configure for Development

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.hermes/{cron,sessions,logs,memories,skills}
cp cli-config.yaml.example ~/.hermes/config.yaml
touch ~/.hermes/.env

# Add at minimum an LLM provider key:
echo 'OPENROUTER_API_KEY=sk-or-v1-your-key' >> ~/.hermes/.env
```

### Run

```bash
# The standard installer already put `hermes` on PATH.
hermes doctor
hermes chat -q "Hello"
```

If you used the manual clone fallback, run `./hermes` from the checkout or
symlink this clone's venv explicitly:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.local/bin
ln -sf "$(pwd)/venv/bin/hermes" ~/.local/bin/hermes
```

### Run Tests

```bash
scripts/run_tests.sh
```

## Code Style

- **PEP 8** with practical exceptions (no strict line length enforcement)
- **Comments**: Only when explaining non-obvious intent, trade-offs, or API quirks
- **Error handling**: Catch specific exceptions. Use `logger.warning()`/`logger.error()` with `exc_info=True` for unexpected errors
- **Cross-platform**: Never assume Unix (see below)
- **Profile-safe paths**: Never hardcode `~/.hermes` — use `get_hermes_home()` from `hermes_constants` for code paths and `display_hermes_home()` for user-facing messages. See [AGENTS.md](https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent/blob/main/AGENTS.md#profiles-multi-instance-support) for full rules.

## Cross-Platform Compatibility

See **[Platform Support](../getting-started/platform-support.md)**. Native Windows uses Git Bash (from [Git for Windows](https://git-scm.com/download/win)) for shell commands. A few features require POSIX kernel primitives and are gated: the dashboard's embedded PTY terminal pane (`/chat` tab) needs a POSIX PTY (Linux, macOS, or WSL2). If you're doing Windows-heavy dev, run the Windows-footgun lint (`scripts/check-windows-footguns.py`) before pushing.

When contributing code, keep these rules in mind:

- **Don't add unguarded `signal.SIGKILL` references.** It's not defined on Windows. Either route through `gateway.status.terminate_pid(pid, force=True)` (the centralized primitive that does `taskkill /T /F` on Windows and SIGKILL on POSIX), or fall back with `getattr(signal, "SIGKILL", signal.SIGTERM)`.
- **Catch `OSError` alongside `ProcessLookupError` on `os.kill(pid, 0)` probes.** Windows raises `OSError` (WinError 87, "parameter is incorrect") for an already-gone PID instead of `ProcessLookupError`.
- **Don't force the terminal to POSIX semantics.** `os.setsid`, `os.killpg`, `os.getpgid`, `os.fork` all raise on Windows — gate them with `if sys.platform != "win32":` or `if os.name != "nt":`.
- **Open files with an explicit `encoding="utf-8"`.** The Python default on Windows is the system locale (often cp1252), which mojibakes or crashes on non-Latin text.
- **Use `pathlib.Path` / `os.path.join` — never manually concat with `/`.** This matters less for strings the OS gives us back and more for strings we construct to hand to subprocesses.

Key patterns:

### 1. File encoding

Some environments may save `.env` files in non-UTF-8 encodings:

```python
try:
    load_dotenv(env_path)
except UnicodeDecodeError:
    load_dotenv(env_path, encoding="latin-1")
```

### 2. Process management

`os.setsid()`, `os.killpg()`, and signal handling differ across platforms:

```python
import platform
if platform.system() != "Windows":
    kwargs["preexec_fn"] = os.setsid
```

### 3. Path separators

Use `pathlib.Path` instead of string concatenation with `/`.

## Security Considerations

Hermes has terminal access. Security matters.

### Existing Protections

| Layer                           | Implementation                                                              |
| ------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Sudo password piping**        | Uses `shlex.quote()` to prevent shell injection                             |
| **Dangerous command detection** | Regex patterns in `tools/approval.py` with user approval flow               |
| **Cron prompt injection**       | Scanner blocks instruction-override patterns                                |
| **Write deny list**             | Protected paths resolved via `os.path.realpath()` to prevent symlink bypass |
| **Skills guard**                | Security scanner for hub-installed skills                                   |
| **Code execution sandbox**      | Child process runs with API keys stripped                                   |
| **Container hardening**         | Docker: all capabilities dropped, no privilege escalation, PID limits       |

### Contributing Security-Sensitive Code

- Always use `shlex.quote()` when interpolating user input into shell commands
- Resolve symlinks with `os.path.realpath()` before access control checks
- Don't log secrets
- Catch broad exceptions around tool execution
- Test on all platforms if your change touches file paths or processes

## Pull Request Process

### Branch Naming

```
fix/description        # Bug fixes
feat/description       # New features
docs/description       # Documentation
test/description       # Tests
refactor/description   # Code restructuring
```

### Before Submitting

1. **Run tests**: `scripts/run_tests.sh` for CI-parity. Use direct `python -m pytest ...` only when the wrapper is unavailable or you are intentionally debugging outside the wrapper.
2. **Test manually**: Run `hermes` and exercise the code path you changed
3. **Check cross-platform impact**: Consider macOS, Linux, WSL2, and native Windows. If you touch file I/O, process management, terminal handling, subprocesses, or signals, run `scripts/check-windows-footguns.py`.
4. **Keep PRs focused**: One logical change per PR

### PR Description

Include:

- **What** changed and **why**
- **How to test** it
- **What platforms** you tested on
- Reference any related issues

```

### Repo-local review checklists: `.agents/checks/*.md`

Projects built on (or reviewed by) Hermes can keep reviewer checklists inside the repository under `.agents/checks/`. Each file is a focused, plain-markdown checklist that an agent loads before reviewing a change touching the matching area:

```
.agents/
  checks/
    security.md        # e.g. "grep the diff for shell interpolation; check subprocess calls quote args"
    migrations.md      # e.g. "every schema change ships a backfill and a rollback note"
    public-api.md      # e.g. "exported signatures changed? flag for semver review"
```

Conventions that make these work well:

- **One concern per file**, named after the concern. Small files get read in full; a monolithic `checklist.md` gets skimmed.
- **Write checks as verifiable actions** ("run X and confirm Y"), not aspirations ("code should be secure").
- **State the trigger at the top** — which paths or change types the checklist applies to — so an agent (or human) can skip irrelevant ones cheaply.
- Keep them in version control next to the code they guard: they evolve with the codebase, and a PR that changes the rules changes the checklist in the same diff.

When you ask Hermes to review a PR in a repository that has `.agents/checks/`, tell it (or teach it via a skill) to read the relevant checklists first and report against them. This gives review agents the project-specific bar that generic review prompts miss.
