"""Subconscious tick — Marvi's periodic world-diff + goal-aware reasoning pass.

Workstream A's slice of the "subconscious" concept from the
2026-07-09-marvi-subconscious-presence design spec. Owns exactly ONE
built-in cron job (``cron.jobs.create_job`` — NO second job engine) that:

  1. runs a mechanical pre-script (Contract 1:
     ``cron/scripts/subconscious_snapshot.py``, owned by Workstream C) that
     prints the literal line ``NO_CHANGE`` or a human-readable diff. When
     the script prints ``NO_CHANGE``, ``cron.scheduler._parse_wake_gate``
     short-circuits the tick BEFORE the LLM stage — zero LLM cost when
     nothing in the user's world changed.
  2. otherwise runs a stage-2 LLM pass with the diff injected as context
     (via the job's ``script`` field — the standard cron script-injection
     mechanism) plus the active goal store (already in every system
     prompt, see ``agent/system_prompt.py``) and recent memory. The pass
     ends the turn with ``[SILENT]``, a delivered proactive message, or a
     registered suggestion (``cron/suggestions.py``, source="subconscious",
     via the ``suggest_automation`` tool).

``hermes subconscious enable|disable|status`` (``hermes_cli/subconscious.py``)
is the CLI surface. Config keys live under ``subconscious.*`` in
config.yaml per Contract 3.
