//     echo/ambient residual after AEC sits at ~0.006-0.02 during playback and the
//     old 0.22 threshold was never reached, so barge-in never fired. 0.06 clears
//     that residual while staying reachable by real speech. If SPEAKER echo
//     self-triggers, raise this (watch the `[voice-presence] barge-in level` logs
//     WHILE talking over Marvi — set it between the echo peak and your speech peak).
//   graceMs: ignore the first N ms of playback (avoids the TTS onset click).
//   sustainedMs: how long speech must persist before it counts as an interrupt.
