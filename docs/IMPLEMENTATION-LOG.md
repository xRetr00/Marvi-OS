# Implementation Log

This is the chronological record of work that has actually happened. Planned
work belongs in `docs/phases/`; architectural decisions belong in
`docs/DECISIONS.md`.

## 2026-08-16 — repository foundation

- Created the independent `D:\Marvi-OS` Git repository as `marvi-os`.
- Added the product, architecture, UI, upstream, environment, and voice-model
  evaluation contracts.
- Adopted an Electron Vite React/TypeScript desktop scaffold instead of writing
  Electron process plumbing from scratch.
- Added the first main control-center shell, sidebar, persistent status bar,
  About placeholder, tray lifetime, and always-on Island surface.
- Added a minimal Python Marvi Gateway health facade and LiveKit worker
  configuration scaffold.
- Added initial behavior tests and verified typecheck, tests, lint, build, and
  dependency audit.
- Recorded as Git commit `24ca7af` (`feat: bootstrap Marvi OS foundation`).

## 2026-08-16 — Marvi design alignment and native Island correction

- Reviewed `D:\hermes-agent\apps\desktop\AGENTS.md`, `DESIGN.md`, theme tokens,
  font declarations, the voice-Island renderer, and its Electron overlay.
- Identified the first Marvi OS Island defect: a fixed `356×78`, draggable,
  focusable host containing a fixed 340 px pill. The oversized native surface
  made the overlay read as a conventional window.
- Replaced the fixed host contract with validated, content-sized native bounds.
  The renderer reports actual pill dimensions; Electron adds only a 12 px
  transparent shadow inset, recenters the host, and clamps all values.
- Made the passive Island non-focusable, non-movable, click-through,
  taskbar-free, frameless, shadowless at the OS level, and fully transparent.
- Removed the draggable full-window button and native tooltip behavior.
- Synchronized preview state from the control center to the actual Island via a
  narrow preload bridge.
- Adopted Marvi's Collapse brand face and bundled JetBrains Mono faces, and
  aligned the shell with the flat, token-driven monochrome design contract.
- Added unit coverage for Island size validation and positioning.
- Verified the running native windows as `1180×760` for the control center and
  `174×54` for the ready Island. A desktop capture confirmed that pixels behind
  the utility surface remain visible outside the pill.

Validation evidence and the resulting commit are recorded in
[`phases/02-desktop-island.md`](phases/02-desktop-island.md).

## 2026-08-16 — Phase 2 recessed seed and icon milestone

- Matched old Marvi's passive Island behavior: a transparent `76×8` seed at the
  top edge, rendering only a breathing 34 px line until activity begins.
- Replaced runtime downsampling of the 1254 px source with deterministic
  renderer, runtime, tray, package PNG, and multi-resolution Windows ICO assets.
- Added the canonical icon to the sidebar and a real About surface with build
  and component information.
- Added README-maintenance and milestone-commit rules to `AGENTS.md`.
