"""Idle trigger — fires one subconscious tick after N minutes of user silence.

Workstream A's gateway hook for Contract 3's
``subconscious.idle_trigger_minutes``. Reuses the gateway's existing
"last inbound seen" clock (``MarviGateway._last_inbound_at``, stamped at
the single inbound chokepoint in ``_handle_message`` for every real,
non-internal message — see gateway/run.py, added for scale-to-zero)
instead of adding a second observation point. Debounced so sustained
silence fires the tick exactly once per idle window: a fresh inbound
message resets the window and re-arms the trigger for the next one.

No new engine: firing the trigger just calls
``cron.subconscious.trigger_tick``, which nudges the SAME built-in cron job
the ``marvi subconscious`` CLI manages (``cron.jobs.trigger_job`` sets
``next_run_at`` to now; the existing 60s ticker picks it up on its next
loop iteration).
