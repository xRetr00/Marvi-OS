"""Flow gate -- holds proactive/cron-originated deliveries while the user
is heads-down in a focus app (IDE/editor/terminal), flushing when they go
afk or switch away.

Wired into ``gateway/delivery.py`` with the smallest possible edit: a
single ``await wait_if_gated(metadata)`` at the top of
``DeliveryRouter._deliver_to_platform``.

Why that call site is the right (and only) gate point: ``_deliver_to_platform``
is exclusively reached from ``DeliveryRouter.deliver()`` (cron job output
delivery) and directly from ``cron/scheduler.py``'s live-adapter send path
for the running gateway loop -- both are cron/scheduled delivery, and both
stamp ``"job_id"`` into ``metadata``. Live conversational replies are sent
by the platform adapter directly inside ``gateway/run.py``'s message
handler and never call ``DeliveryRouter`` at all, so gating here is
naturally a no-op for direct replies without needing a separate origin
flag threaded through the whole send path.

No-op (delivers immediately) unless ALL of:
  - the delivery is cron/proactive-originated (``metadata["job_id"]`` set),
  - ``presence.enabled`` and ``presence.flow_gating`` are both true,
  - ActivityWatch is reachable, and
  - the user is currently not-afk with a focus-app (IDE/editor/terminal)
    window in the foreground.

Never loses a message: while held, delivery resumes on whichever comes
first --
  - the user going afk or switching away from the focus app (checked on a
    bounded poll interval),
  - a fail-open max-hold ceiling (:data:`MAX_HOLD_SECONDS`), or
  - process shutdown -- an ``atexit`` hook flips a module-level "flush now"
    flag that every currently-waiting poll observes on its next tick, so a
    held message is delivered rather than dropped when the gateway exits.

Deliberately simple (in-memory only, per the design spec): a held item is
just a live coroutine parked in ``asyncio.sleep``, not a persisted queue.
If the process is killed (not a graceful shutdown), the held delivery is
lost -- exactly as it would be for any other in-flight async gateway work.
