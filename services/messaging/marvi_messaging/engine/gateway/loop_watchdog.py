"""Event-loop lag watchdog — detects backend freezes and names the blocker.

The desktop backend (``runtime_support/web_server.py``'s FastAPI app) and the
gateway (``gateway/run.py``) are both long-lived single-event-loop
processes. A synchronous blocking call anywhere in an ``async def`` handler
(a `requests.get()`, a `time.sleep()`, an expensive file read, ...) stalls
*every* concurrent WebSocket connection, HTTP request, and background
watcher — the user experiences this as "the backend froze."

This module answers two questions when that happens:

  1. **How bad was it?** — a background thread maintains an independent
     wall-clock heartbeat that the event loop is expected to touch every
     ``interval_seconds`` (default 0.5s, via ``loop.call_later``). If the
     watcher notices the heartbeat go stale by more than ``threshold_ms``
     (default 250ms), that means the loop thread has been off doing
     something else for at least that long.
  2. **What was running?** — critically, the stack sample is taken by the
     *watcher thread*, independently, **while the loop thread is still
     stalled** (not after the delayed heartbeat callback finally fires).
     By the time a delayed ``call_later`` callback runs, the blocking call
     that caused the delay has already returned — sampling from inside it
     would just show the heartbeat's own frame, not the offender. Sampling
     from a separate thread via ``sys._current_frames()[loop_thread_id]``
     mid-stall captures the actual blocking function.

Emits a single grep-friendly ``[LOOP-LAG] ...`` line per stall, throttled to
once per 5s so a long stall doesn't spam the log.

Config: ``logging.loop_watchdog.enabled`` (default true) and
``logging.loop_watchdog.threshold_ms`` (default 250) in ``config.yaml`` —
see ``runtime_support/config.py``'s ``DEFAULT_CONFIG["logging"]["loop_watchdog"]``.

Mirrors ``gateway.memory_monitor``'s shape (module-level state guarded by a
lock, ``start_*`` / ``stop_*`` / ``is_running`` API, safe to call from either
process) so both processes wire it up the same way.
