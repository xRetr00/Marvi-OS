""""Goblin mode" -- opt-in proactive presence features (Contract 3:
``presence.goblin.*``, default OFF).

Two independent pieces:

  - **Shoulder taps**: :func:`check_stuck` is a pure heuristic over a
    window-event history that flags "the user has probably been stuck for
    a while". :func:`check_stuck_and_notify` wraps it with the AW query,
    the config gate, and a debounced (>= 2h) proactive nudge delivered via
    the existing cron delivery path. By default (``presence.goblin.
    investigation``) the nudge job investigates first -- reading the
    identified file/workspace and/or searching the web for the error text --
    before sending a short diagnosis + suggestion, replying ``[SILENT]``
    when it finds nothing useful; set ``investigation: false`` to fall back
    to the old message-only "want help?" offer.
  - **Session priming**: :func:`session_priming_summary` renders a
    one-paragraph plain-English summary of the last hour of presence, for
    injection at the start of a new conversation session (zero-cold-start).

Both are safe no-ops when ActivityWatch is unavailable or the relevant
``presence.goblin.*`` flag is off.
