"""show_card tool: surface a compact card on the user's voice presence.

Voice-first "show, don't say": when the agent wants to display a short result,
list, link, or a confirm prompt instead of speaking it, it calls show_card and
the desktop renders it on the Dynamic Island (the always-present pill at the top
of the screen). The tool is exposed to desktop and voice agents, where one
payload renders in chat and on the Dynamic Island.
