"""Adaptive retrieval / retrospective reflection -- Loop 4 of the "memory
maturity" round (see
``docs/superpowers/specs/2026-07-17-marvi-memory-maturity-spec.md``).

Today ``tools.memory_tool.MemoryStore`` injects its ENTIRE frozen snapshot
into every prompt in fixed (insertion) order -- it never learns that some
entries are more useful than others. This module adds a soft, bounded
usefulness signal per § entry and uses it to bias *ordering* (and, only when
the char budget genuinely forces a choice, *selection*) of entries at render
time. It NEVER deletes or archives an entry -- that remains decay's job
(``agent/memory/decay.py``, Loop 3); a downweighted entry can always recover
because weights are clamped to a floor, never driven to zero.

Module boundary: this is a standalone module (not a section bolted onto
``tools/memory_tool.py``) so the store class stays lean and the usefulness
math/storage is independently unit-testable. ``tools/memory_tool.py`` only
gets two small, additive hooks: ``MemoryStore._rank_for_render()`` (calls
``rank_entries`` here) and one call to ``capture_previous_batch_outcome()``
from ``format_for_system_prompt()``. All imports are lazy/deferred on both
sides specifically to avoid a module-load-time circular import between the
two files (mirrors the existing ``agent/memory/decay.py`` <->
``tools/memory_tool.py`` pattern).

Injection -> outcome linkage (read this before touching the capture logic)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
The spec's ideal is per-TURN linkage: know exactly which entries were
injected into the turn that just got a correction. That isn't cleanly
available here without invasive changes to the live turn path: MemoryStore's
system-prompt snapshot is frozen once per SESSION (the whole point of the
frozen-snapshot design is prefix-cache stability -- see
``tools/memory_tool.py``'s module docstring), and
``format_for_system_prompt()`` only stamps the decay sidecar
(``memory/surfaced.json``) the FIRST time it's called per target per store
instance. So the finest granularity actually available without touching the
turn/voice path is per-SESSION, not per-turn.

This module embraces that and documents it as the approximation:

  * ``capture_previous_batch_outcome()`` runs once per store instance, at
    the START of a session (from inside ``format_for_system_prompt()``,
    before it stamps THIS session's fresh batch). It looks at the *previous*
    session's surfaced batch -- the entries sharing the newest
    ``last_surfaced`` timestamp in ``memory/surfaced.json`` -- and checks
    whether a correction was recorded (``agent.learning.outcomes``,
    ``loop="escalation", event="corrected"``) any time since that
    timestamp. If yes, those entries get nudged DOWN by ``learning_rate``;
    if the session closed clean, they get nudged UP.

This reuses the EXISTING correction signal (the same ``is_correction()``
detection the escalation loop already uses in the voice duplex handler,
``runtime_support/web_server.py``) without adding any new call into that -- or
any other -- turn-processing / voice code path. It is intentionally
coarser than per-turn (an entire session's surfaced set moves together),
and intentionally best-effort: any failure here is logged and swallowed,
never surfaced to the caller, and never affects the live turn.
