# uni_portal

## What this is

A daily, browser-automated check of the user's own Duzce University student
system — grades, announcements, class schedule — with a proactive message
only when something actually changed since the last check. Part of the
Marvi freedom/autonomy spec (Part 1, §1.3): Marvi visiting an account the
user explicitly asked it to watch, on their own machine, with their own
credentials.

## Security / credential boundary — read this before touching this plugin

- **Credentials are never stored in `config.yaml`, in code, or in any file
  Marvi's other memory/logging paths touch.** They live exclusively in the
  Windows Credential Manager, written and read through
  `plugins/uni_portal/credentials.py`'s thin `ctypes` wrapper around
  `Advapi32.dll` (`CredWrite`/`CredRead`/`CredDelete`) — the same class of
  OS-native secret store other Marvi credential flows use, not a bespoke
  encrypted file.
- **Enrollment is interactive and CLI-only.** The user runs `marvi uni
  login`, types their username/password directly into the terminal prompt,
  and `runtime_support/subcommands/uni.py` stores it immediately. Marvi (the
  agent/LLM) never sees the password — it isn't in any prompt, tool
  argument, or model context at any point.
- **The plaintext password is read from the credential store only inside
  `plugins/uni_portal/portal.py::login()`**, at the moment it's typed into
  the portal's login form, and the local Python reference is dropped
  immediately after. It is never logged, never written to a snapshot, and
  never included in the proactive notification message or the episodic/graph
  records `plugins/uni_portal/check.py` creates.
- **2FA and CAPTCHA are a hard stop, never a bypass target.** If the portal
  shows either after a login attempt, `portal.py::login()` raises
  `LoginBlocked` and `check.py` routes straight to the ask-user channel
  (`agent.autonomy.ask.ask_user`) asking the human to handle it. There is no
  code path that attempts to solve or circumvent either.
- **No raw portal transcripts are kept.** Only the diffed snapshot
  (`MARVI_MESSAGING_HOME/uni_portal/snapshot.json` — course/grade pairs,
  announcement title+date, schedule rows) persists between runs; the actual
  page HTML/accessibility-tree snapshots used during a single check are
  never written to disk.

## Enrollment

```
marvi uni login              # interactive: prompts for username + password,
                               # stores to the OS credential store, enables
                               # uni_portal.enabled and schedules the daily job
marvi uni status              # shows whether credentials are stored + last check result
marvi uni check                # runs one check immediately (same as the daily job)
marvi uni login --logout      # deletes stored credentials, disables the daily job
```

## Configuration (`config.yaml`, not user-facing in the Mind UI today)

```yaml
uni_portal:
  enabled: false                 # flipped true by `marvi uni login`
  check_schedule: "0 18 * * *"   # daily at 18:00 local
  portal_url: ""                 # the login page URL -- fill in for your Duzce portal
  grades_path: ""                # grades page URL, once logged in
  announcements_path: ""         # announcements page URL
  schedule_path: ""              # class schedule page URL
```

`portal_url`/`grades_path`/`announcements_path`/`schedule_path` are
deliberately not hardcoded — Duzce's actual portal URLs need to be filled in
against the real site during enrollment (the login-field/submit-button
detection in `portal.py` is a best-effort keyword heuristic over the page's
accessibility tree, not portal-specific selectors, so it also benefits from
being pointed at the real login page during setup rather than guessed).

## What still needs live validation

The control flow (login → collect → diff → notify → save snapshot,
2FA/CAPTCHA stop-and-ask, credential-store round-trip) is unit-tested with
fakes in `tests/plugins/uni_portal/`. The actual DOM interaction against the
live Duzce portal — whether the username/password/submit-button keyword
heuristics in `portal.py` correctly find the right elements, and whether the
generic table-row scraper in `collect_grades`/`collect_announcements`
extracts the right columns — has not been (and cannot be, without a real
account) exercised end-to-end. Expect to tune the `*_path` config values and
possibly the heuristic hint tuples in `portal.py` after first live
enrollment.
