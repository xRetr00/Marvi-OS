"""Slack delta fetcher -- Composio smart sync for Marvi.

Cursor is a last-seen Slack timestamp (``ts``, Slack's float-seconds string
format) per surface, mirroring GitHub's ``since`` cursor: each fetch asks
"what's new since this timestamp" rather than pulling full channel history.

First run establishes the baseline timestamp at "now" and reports nothing
changed -- everything already sitting unread at connect time is pre-existing
noise, not a new delta to surface (same rationale as ``github.py``).

Deliberately does NOT fetch full channel history (``conversations.history``
style pulls): the assumed Composio action returns activity *summaries*
(unread direct-message conversations and thread mentions, each already
carrying a short preview of the latest relevant message) rather than raw
message logs, so one call covers a tick without walking every channel.
