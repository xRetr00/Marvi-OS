"""Composio smart-sync snapshot script -- Contract 1 entry point.

Invoked by Marvi's subconscious-tick cron job (Workstream A,
``cron/subconscious.py``) as a pre-script: the tick runs this, and only pays
for an LLM pass when this script reports something actually changed.

Per Contract 1 (see the design spec)::

    The script prints to stdout either the literal line ``NO_CHANGE`` (tick
    exits, zero LLM cost) or a human-readable diff of what changed.

This script iterates the surfaces configured under ``composio.surfaces`` in
config.yaml, calls each surface's delta fetcher
(``cron/scripts/subconscious/<surface>.py::fetch_delta``), and aggregates.
Every fetch is a DELTA fetch against a locally-stored cursor
(``~/.marvi/subconscious/snapshots/<surface>.json``) -- never a blind full
refetch -- which is what keeps this cheap enough to run on every tick
without burning API rate limits (the explicit anti-goal from the design
spec: no OpenHuman-style polling waste).

Alongside the configured Composio surfaces, "builtin" surfaces (local,
non-Composio fetchers -- currently just ``smart_room``, see
``cron.scripts.subconscious.base.BUILTIN_SURFACES``) are auto-included
whenever their plugin looks active, no ``composio.surfaces`` entry needed.
Both kinds go through the exact same per-surface fetch/throttle/backoff loop
(:func:`_fetch_surface_section`).

A surface that isn't connected, is rate-limited, or errors out is logged to
stderr and skipped; it can never crash this script or block the other
surfaces from being checked.

Runnable standalone::

    python cron/scripts/subconscious_snapshot.py

Exits 0 always (a broken surface is a stderr warning + skip, not a process
failure) so the cron pre-script step never itself trips an error path in the
scheduler.
